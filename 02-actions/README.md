## Goals
- Know what actions are (fire-and-forget effects)
- Know the difference between entry, exit, and transition ("do") actions 
- Recognize when an action should be an entry/exit action rather than a transition action
- Know how to implement & parameterize actions in XState

## Exercises

1. Add entry actions for the play and paused state
2. Add transition actions for liking and unliking a song
3. Add a transition action for skipping an song
4. Serialize these actions and provide their implementation in `.withConfig(...)`
